00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,170
Welcome to Section 3 of The Complete Android app of course now that you're fairly familiar with the

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,840
android studio interface and you know how Android apps are put together.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,730
We're going to take a deep dive into Java.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,840
So this means we'll be looking at the features of the programming language including variables arrays

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:25,100
and maps and then going on to more advanced structures like if statements loops classes and objects.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,080
But don't worry your work will be boring.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,720
Dry code will be writing real apps as well including a higher or lower game and another app called number

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,600
shapes.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,870
So there's a lot to learn but once you've covered the basics of Java you will be able to build far more

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,510
advanced apps than we've built so far.

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:46,790
At the same time as always I hope you're continuing to work through my book HOWTO and $10000 while learning

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,560
to code.

13
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,610
And maybe by the end of this section you'll have a list of four or five different apps that you might

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,970
want to build.

15
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,430
These don't have to be world beating moneymaking apps they can just be simple ideas that you'd like

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,560
to put together and then share with the world on Google Play.

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:07,730
There's nothing like having a real app built and out there with users using it to encourage you to build

18
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,280
more.

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,740
And of course to force you to learn things that you wouldn't necessarily need to know without building

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,750
an actual app.

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,870
So I hope that's going on in the background as well and I hope you enjoy this section.

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,310
I'll see you at the beginning of Section 4.
