Hello and welcome to the permanent data storage section.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,080
I know that's a little bit of a media title.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,540
Their data storage section it sounds a little bit more intense than it is.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,900
The basic idea here is we've been building some awesome apps for example that favorite locations out

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:20,160
but we haven't been able to save any information as soon as we close the app bring a back up it's like

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,260
we're here for the very first time and that's not ideal for most of the apps that we're going to build.

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,880
So in this section you're going to learn how do you store and save information we're going to learn

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,510
how to do some of it in a little bit of a local easy to use situation.

9
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,250
But also we're going to learn how to work with a full blown QOL database now don't worry if you don't

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,660
know that is maybe you've heard about it before but you're going to learn a little bit about the programming

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,490
language called.

12
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,150
Q Well I guess it's not technically a programming language but we'll dive into that too.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,030
But go ahead and enjoy permanent data storage.
